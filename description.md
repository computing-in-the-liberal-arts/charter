- [Stated Goals/Focus of the Committee](https://sigcse.org/programs/committees/liberal.html)

- An updated charter for this Committee is available at: [**here**](https://sigcse.org/programs/committees/reports/Liberal_Arts_Computing_Education_Committee_Charter_2019.pdf).

- Computing programs in liberal arts colleges face two obvious needs. First, someone needs to speak for the liberal arts computing community in larger discussions of computing education. The need is being recognized - for example, the CS2013 committee deliberately recruited members from liberal arts colleges - but no current organization can be considered truly representative of today's liberal arts computing community. Second, faculty in liberal arts computing programs need a network for sharing ideas with similarly situated colleagues. This SIGCSE committee will investigate how widespread these two needs are, identify other needs related to liberal arts computing programs, and propose ways of addressing - for the whole community - any needs it identifies.

- The committee conducted a Special Session and a couple of BoFs at SIGCSE 2017 to report on interim results (mainly a survey of the state of computing programs at liberal arts colleges) and to solicit feedback from the community. Notes from the special session are available [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BIvw0w7vryA1qA-TwJ1TK_fWjDHH7H7H6LyXVPObKhc).
